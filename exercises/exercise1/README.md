Define a class IntArray, which resembles one dimensional array (allowing max size -> 10 000 000).  
The class should contain: 
* Constructors; 
* Destructor;
* Method for adding a value; 
* Method for getting a value at specific index; 
* Method which checks if the array contains a given value;
* Method for sorting the array;

Implement the methods in the most effective way you can think of.

Store the interface of the class and its implementation in different files. The interface in a header file and the implementation in a .cpp file.
